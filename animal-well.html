    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Animal Well is a 2d platformer created by Billy Basso. Billy started the project himself in 2017 and finally finished making the game in 2024 on May 9. Billy used various programming techniques and tools to optimize performance and stability during the development of Animal Well. He prioritized quality by frequently testing and debugging to ensure that each new feature met his standards before even thinking of expanding the scope of the game.</p>
